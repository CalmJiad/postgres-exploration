Database Design and SDLC Overview
This README provides a concise guide to key concepts in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), database design techniques, Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram creation, database anomalies, normalization, and functional dependencies. It is intended for developers and system designers to understand and apply these principles effectively.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The SDLC is a structured process for developing software systems. It consists of the following phases:

Planning: Define project goals, scope, and resources.
Analysis/Reasoning: Gather and analyze requirements.
System Design: Create system architecture and design specifications.
Building: Develop the system by coding and implementation.
Testing: Verify and validate the system to ensure it meets requirements.
Deployment/Launch: Release the system to production.

Examples of SDLC Methodologies:

Agile Methodology: Iterative and flexible, emphasizing collaboration and adaptability.
Waterfall Methodology: Linear and sequential, with distinct phases.

Database Design Techniques
Database design can be approached using two primary techniques:

Top-Down Technique: Design the database from scratch, starting with high-level requirements and refining into detailed schemas.
Bottom-Up Technique: Build the database by migrating or integrating an existing system, often reverse-engineering from data sources.

Creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
An ER diagram visually represents the database structure. Follow these steps to create one:
Step 1: Determine Entities
Entities represent objects like a person, place, or thing (e.g., Student, Mentor). Characteristics include:

Properties or Attributes: Describe the entity (e.g., name, ID).
Unique Identity: Each entity has a unique identifier (e.g., primary key).
Singular Name: Use a singular noun (e.g., "Student" instead of "Students").
Multiple Instances: Ensure the entity can have multiple data instances.

Step 2: Determine Attributes for Each Entity
Attributes describe entities and must:

Be directly related to the entity.
Be atomic (indivisible, single-valued).
Include keys (e.g., primary or foreign keys) to identify records.

Step 3: Define Relationships Among Entities
Relationships describe connections between entities (tables). Common relationship types include:

One-to-One: One record in a table links to one record in another.
One-to-Many: One record links to multiple records in another table.
Many-to-One: Multiple records link to one record in another table.
Many-to-Many: Multiple records link to multiple records in another table.
Optional One-to-One or Zero: A record may or may not link to another.
Optional Many-to-Many: Multiple records may or may not link to others.

Note: Many-to-many relationships can introduce complexity in data management. To maintain a balanced and structured database, designers often avoid them by introducing junction tables to break them into simpler relationships.
Database Anomalies
Anomalies are inconsistencies or issues during data manipulation or retrieval. The three main types are:

Update Anomalies: Inconsistent updates due to redundant data.
Delete Anomalies: Unintended data loss when deleting records.
Insert Anomalies: Difficulty inserting data due to missing dependencies.

Normalization
Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy (no duplicate data) and improve data integrity (accurate and consistent data). The most common normal forms are:

0NF: Unnormalized, with repeating groups or non-atomic data.
1NF: First Normal Form, meeting basic structural requirements.
2NF: Second Normal Form, addressing partial dependencies.
3NF: Third Normal Form, eliminating transitive dependencies.

Rules for 1NF (First Normal Form)
A table is in 1NF if it satisfies these rules:

Atomic Values: Each cell contains a single, indivisible value.
Unique Column Names: Columns have distinct names.
Positional Dependency of Data: Data meaning does not depend on column order.
Same Data Type: All values in a column are of the same type.
Primary Key: A unique identifier is defined for each record.

Rules for 2NF (Second Normal Form)
A table is in 2NF if:

It is already in 1NF.
No non-key attribute is functionally dependent on a proper subset of a candidate key.

Partial Dependency: Occurs when a non-key column depends on only part of a composite key, violating 2NF. To fix, move such columns to a separate table where they depend on a single key.
Rules for 3NF (Third Normal Form)
A table is in 3NF if:

It is already in 2NF.
It contains no transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depending on other non-key attributes).

Functional Dependency
A functional dependency describes a relationship where one column determines another. It is denoted as X → Y, meaning if two rows have the same value in column X, they must have the same value in column Y. For example:

If t1.x = t2.x, then t1.y = t2.y.

Decomposition
Decomposition involves splitting a large table into smaller ones to improve design, often during normalization. However:

Lossy Decomposition: Occurs when data is lost or corrupted upon joining tables, which should be avoided to maintain data integrity.Database Design and SDLC Overview
