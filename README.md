# 🐘 PostgreSQL Exploration

Welcome to **PostgreSQL Exploration** — a hands-on playground and reference guide for learning and practicing **PostgreSQL**, one of the most powerful and advanced open-source relational database systems.

---

## 📚 About This Repository

This repo contains:

- ✅ Practice SQL scripts (`.sql` files)
- ✅ Annotated examples for core SQL commands (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `ALTER`, `JOIN`, etc.)
- ✅ Schema definitions and data manipulation examples
- ✅ Notes and comments that explain **what each line does** (great for revision)
- ✅ Constraint usage (`PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, etc.)
- ✅ Table operations (`CREATE`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `RENAME`, etc.)

## 🧠 What is PostgreSQL?

**PostgreSQL** (also known as Postgres) is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for:

- ✔️ Data integrity and reliability
- ✔️ Advanced SQL features (CTEs, window functions, JSON, etc.)
- ✔️ ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- ✔️ Full-text search, indexing, and constraint systems
- ✔️ Extensibility (custom types, functions, and plugins)

## 🛠️ Key SQL Concepts Covered in This Repository

- `SELECT`: Retrieve data using various clauses like `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `LIMIT`
- `INSERT`: Add new data into tables
- `UPDATE`: Modify existing records
- `DELETE`: Remove data from tables
- `ALTER`: Change table structure (add/remove/rename columns, modify types)
- `JOIN`: Merge data from multiple tables
- `CONSTRAINTS`: Implement rules like `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`
- `TRUNCATE` vs `DELETE`: Understand data deletion differences
- `DROP`: Remove entire tables
- `CREATE`: Table and column creation (coming soon)

Each file is written with **clear, inline comments** so that it's easy to follow and reuse.

## 🧪 How to Use This Repo

1. **Open the SQL files** using your favorite PostgreSQL tool, such as:

   - [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
   - [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
   - [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
   - [valentina](https://valentina-db.com/en/valentina-studio-overview)
   - PostgreSQL CLI (`psql`)

2. **Run the scripts step by step** and observe how each command modifies the data or schema.

3. **Read the inline comments** to understand _why_ each command is used.

4. **Modify the queries** and experiment to strengthen your learning.
